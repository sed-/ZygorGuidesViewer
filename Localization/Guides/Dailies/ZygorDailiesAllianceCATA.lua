.' Talk to the riders on mounts around this area
.' Tell them you are ready to fight!
.' Fight and defeat them|tip The best strategy to defeat the Champion riders is to always make sure your shield is up by using your Defend ability.  Make sure your shield is stacked to 3 charges before you begin the fight.  When the fight begins, immediately use your Charge ability on the Champion rider (use your Shield-Breaker ability as you circle around to come back to the Champion rider, if possible).  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Champion rider will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When he starts to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge him in the back (use your Shield-Breaker ability as you circle around to come back to the Champion rider, if possible), then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again.  Keep repeating this process until he is defeated.

Continuing fighting Chillmaw and 2 other Cultist Bombardiers will spawn: 1 when Chillmaw is at about 50% health, and 1 when Chillmaw is at about 25% health.
