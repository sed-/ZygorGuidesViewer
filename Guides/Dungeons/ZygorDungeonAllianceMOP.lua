'_Phase 1_
.' _Eye Beam_ , a green energy beam, is cast every 3 seconds by Eye of C'Thun and deals about 3000 Nature damage to a random target. If another player is within 10 yards of this target, the beam will jump to them, dealing 1.5x the damage dealt to the previous target. Raid members will want to stay spread out to avoid this happening.
.' _Dark Glare_ a red energy beam, deals about 50,000 Shadow damage to any player who passes through the beam. The initial target is random, but he will rotate 180 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. When this happens, move out of its way.
.' _Eye Tentacle_ will spawn 8 small eye tentacles every 45 seconds, knocking back anyone within a few yards of their spawn point.  They use _Mind Flay_ which deals 750 damage every second for 3 seconds. If the group is ready for them they are easily killed due to their low hit points.
.' _Claw Tentacle_ spawn at random locations very often. When they spawn they deal about 1500 damage and a knockback.
'_Phase 2_ starts as soon as the Eye of C'Thun's health reaches 0.
.' _Giant Claw Tentacle_ spawns about every minute. These deal 3500 damage with Ground Rupture, and will need to be tanked due to their high damage. If no one is in range for an attack they will burrow and reappear with full health, repeating the Ground Rupture attack.
.' _Giant Eye Tentacle_ spawns about every minute. These also deal significant damage with Ground Rupture and they cast _Eye Beam_, which bounces off nearby raid members. Killing these are a priority.
'_Stomach of C'Thun_
.' Every 10 seconds, a random raid member will be swallowed by C'Thun and dropped into his stomach. Swim out of the acid pools and onto one of the patches of land. _Flesh Tentacles_ have 25,000 health and killing them weakens C'Thun, causing him to turn purple and become vulnerable for 45 seconds. This is the time you use to attack and kill him.

'_Siegecrafter Blackfuse_
.' It helps if 2 teams are assigned to kill the Disassembled Weapon adds that spawn every 30 seconds. The groups will have to alternate between spawns.
.' If a Weapon add is not killed before they reach the northeastern wall, Blackfuse will gain _Energized Defensive Matrix_.
.' _Energized Defense Matrix_ reduces Blackfuse's damage taken by 90%.
.' _Matter Purification Beam_ inflicts 475,000 Fire damage.
.' _Launch Sawblade_ fires a blade at the target, knocking away all players in its path upon firing and dealing 41,000-48,000 damage every second.
.' _Electrostatic Charge_ deals 250,000 Nature damage and increases the target's damage taken from Electrostatic Charge by 100% and Reactive Armor by 200%.
.' _Reactive Armor_ reduces damage taken by 80%. Adds that have this buff should be kited through AoEs on the ground, as they still take normal damage from environmental effects.
.' _Protective Frenzy_ is a buff that increases damage by 100%, health by 250% and granting immunity to immobolize, stun, and slow effects.
.' _Automatic Repair Beam_ Blackfuse heals one of his allies for 5% of their maximum health every 3 seconds. Because of this, adds should be tanked at least 35 yards away from him.

.' _Bloodletting_ causes Skeer's target to bleed, flinging globules of their blood onto the floor around the room that move to a nearby Paragon and heal them.

'_Garrosh Hellscream_
.' An Engineer add spawns on both sides of the room after Garrosh throws a whirling axe at the raid with _Desecrate_. They cast Iron Star, which will release a large rolling wheel into the room that kills any raid members it crushes. A DPS should be assigned to kill an Engineer while the raid stays protected on the safe side of the room, free of the Iron Star wheel.
.' In between main phases the raid will get teleported to 1 of 3 possible zones. Kill the adds in the zone and rush Garrosh, continuing to damage him as much as possible.
.' _Desecrate_ Garrosh throws a whirling axe at the raid, dealing damage on impact and spawning a void zone that deals 75,000 damage every second to all players inside it. Destroying the axe will remove the void zone.
.' _Whirling Corruption_ deals 105,000 Shadow damage to nearby players every 0.5 seconds. The damage decreases the farther away you are from Garrosh.
.' _Touch of Y'Shaarj_ mind controls the targeted player, making them attack other raid members. Bringing them down to 20% health will break the mind control.
.' In Phase 3 Garrosh gains Heart of the Y'Shaarj and takes on a Sha-like appearance. The axes from _Desecrate_ can no longer be destroyed and should simply be avoided while continuing to damage Garrosh. Kill him as fast as possible to avoid death.
