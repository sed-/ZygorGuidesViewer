.'An Argent Champion runs up on a horse
.' Use the abilities on your hotbar to defeat the Argent Champion|tip The best strategy to defeat the Argent Champion is to always make sure your shield is up by using your Defend ability.  Make sure your shield is stacked to 3 charges before you begin the fight.  When the fight begins, immediately use your Charge ability on the Argent Champion.  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Argent Champion will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When he starts to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge him in the back, then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again.  Keep repeating this process until he is defeated.
